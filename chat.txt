	1.	ProtectAI:
	•	Strength: Excellent at predicting the Negative class, with a recall of 1.00, meaning no false negatives for this class.
	•	Weakness: The recall for the Positive class is relatively lower at 0.84, though its precision is perfect (1.00). This indicates some false negatives for this class.
	2.	SavantAI:
	•	Strength: Balanced performance across both classes, with high and consistent precision, recall, and F1-scores for both Negative and Positive classes.
	•	Weakness: Slightly lower precision and recall compared to ProtectAI for the Positive class, but still very strong overall.
	3.	Setfit:
	•	Strength: Moderately better performance in identifying the Negative class with a recall of 0.76.
	•	Weakness: Poor performance on the Positive class, with a precision of 0.34 and a recall of 0.26, indicating significant misclassification for this class.

Best Model Selection:

	•	For applications requiring balanced and high performance for both classes, SavantAI is the most reliable.
	•	If perfect precision for the Positive class or no false negatives in the Negative class is critical, then ProtectAI is preferred.
	•	Setfit may need improvement or hyperparameter tuning before use, as its performance lags significantly behind the other two models.
