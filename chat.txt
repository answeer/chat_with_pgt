. Dataset Preparation

	•	Data Collection: Briefly describe how you gathered your dataset, its purpose, and any relevant characteristics (e.g., size, class distribution).
	•	Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Outline any preprocessing steps such as tokenization, normalization, or feature extraction that you performed to make the data suitable for the model.
	•	Splitting the Dataset: Specify the strategy used to split the data into training, validation, and test sets (e.g., 80-10-10 split). Mention if stratified sampling was used to maintain class balance.

2. Model Selection

	•	Model Description: Name and describe the model(s) used for evaluation, including any custom architectures or hyperparameters specific to your task.
	•	Pre-trained or Custom Models: Note if the model is pre-trained on a similar task or trained from scratch.
	•	Loss Function and Optimization: Document the loss function (especially if using a custom loss function for text classification tasks with Transformers), optimizer, and any relevant learning rate schedules or regularization techniques.

3. Evaluation Metrics

	•	Metric Choice: List the metrics used for evaluating model performance (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc.), and provide a rationale for why they’re appropriate for your task.
	•	Metric Calculation: If any metrics require specific implementations or non-standard methods, outline them. Include any token-based metrics if applicable (e.g., BLEU score for text generation tasks).

4. Evaluation Process

	•	Inference on Dataset: Describe how the model processes the test data, including any batching or memory considerations.
	•	Tracking Metrics: Explain how you track relevant metrics during inference, especially if you need to track additional details like inference time or token counts (as mentioned in previous evaluations).
	•	Token Count and Inference Time: If analyzing the relationship between token count and inference time, describe how this data is collected.

5. Results

	•	Quantitative Results: Present results for each metric, with mean values and, if necessary, standard deviations.
	•	Qualitative Analysis: Include a brief analysis of sample predictions, errors, or any interesting cases where the model performed exceptionally well or poorly.
	•	Comparison of Models: If multiple models were evaluated (e.g., MiniCheck, HHEM, FactualConsistency), compare them side-by-side with both quantitative and qualitative insights.

6. Analysis and Insights

	•	Performance Insights: Provide observations on the model’s strengths and weaknesses, patterns observed in errors, and how well the model generalizes across different samples.
	•	Error Analysis: Identify common failure cases and suggest reasons or potential improvements (e.g., certain classes may be underrepresented, leading to poor generalization).
	•	Token Count and Inference Time Analysis: If you tracked token counts and inference times, present the relationship between them, possibly with a plotted graph to illustrate how token count affects performance.

7. Conclusions

	•	Summarize the evaluation, touching on whether the model met your initial objectives and any insights gained regarding dataset characteristics or model behavior.
	•	Next Steps: Based on the evaluation, mention any steps you might take for further improvements, such as model fine-tuning, dataset augmentation, or exploring different architectures.
