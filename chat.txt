he PiiDetector scanner identifies and, if configured, sanitizes Personally Identifiable Information (PII) within text. Utilizing the Presidio library with custom NLP configurations, it is highly flexible for different types of PII detection tasks.

Key Features and Workflow
PII Detection and Customization:
The PiiDetector relies on custom PII entities and regex patterns defined in an external configuration file. These include the default types of PII to detect (e.g., names, phone numbers) and custom regex patterns for any additional entities.
Tokenization and NLP Setup:
The scanner uses spaCy’s NLP model, specifically the en_core_web_sm model, to enable tokenization and contextual language processing. The NlpEngineProvider creates an NLP engine used for PII detection, optimizing accuracy by leveraging context-aware processing through a LemmaContextAwareEnhancer.
Flexible Regex Patterns:
It supports adding custom regex patterns for specific PII types. These patterns can match entities beyond default PII categories, improving the scanner's ability to adapt to industry-specific data formats.
Sanitization with Presidio Anonymizer:
When sanitize=True, the scanner uses the Presidio Anonymizer to redact detected PII in the text, providing a sanitized version. This feature is especially valuable in applications requiring data privacy compliance, such as GDPR.
Error Handling and Logging:
It logs errors using LogUtil, ensuring that any issues during PII detection or sanitization are recorded with meaningful messages and error levels, helping maintain operational transparency.
Usage Scenarios
Compliance with Data Protection Laws: Automatically redact or detect sensitive information in applications that need to handle personal data securely.
Customizable Data Detection: Adjust detection settings through regex for industry-specific information (e.g., financial data patterns), enhancing the scanner’s utility in specialized fields.
Enhancing Text Anonymization Pipelines: Integrate into NLP or data pipelines where unstructured text needs filtering for sensitive information before analysis or storage.
This scanner’s high configurability and use of Presidio make it robust for a wide variety of PII-related applications.

The PiiDetector scanner is designed to detect and optionally redact (sanitize) Personally Identifiable Information (PII) within text data using the Presidio library. Here’s a breakdown of its functionality:

Key Attributes and Configuration
Sanitize Mode:
When sanitize is enabled, this scanner will attempt to redact any detected PII using predefined anonymization techniques.
By default, sanitize is an optional parameter that can be specified when initializing the scanner.
Entity and Regex Patterns:
This scanner leverages both default entity types (like names, emails, phone numbers) and custom regex patterns specified in a configuration file (pii_detector.yml).
This allows for the detection of both standard PII entities and custom patterns tailored to specific requirements.
Presidio Analyzer Engine:
The scanner initializes a Presidio AnalyzerEngine, which incorporates various recognizers to identify PII entities in text. The engine uses Spacy for Natural Language Processing (NLP) and can analyze text based on both custom and predefined recognizers.
A LemmaContextAwareEnhancer is used to enhance recognition accuracy, accounting for contextual similarities.
Methods
read_config():
Reads configuration from pii_detector.yml to load default_entities and default_regex_patterns.
This enables fine-tuned PII detection by specifying exactly which entities or patterns are of interest.
get_regex_patterns():
Processes regex-based patterns defined in the configuration, converting them into usable formats with details such as context, score, and language.
add_recognizers():
Adds custom regex recognizers to the Presidio RecognizerRegistry.
Supports both predefined recognizers (loaded from the registry) and custom patterns, allowing the scanner to detect unique identifiers not covered by default entities.
get_analyzer():
Configures the Presidio analyzer, loading both standard and custom recognizers and setting up the NLP engine with SpaCy’s model.
Removes redundant recognizers (like SpacyRecognizer) to optimize performance.
PII Detection and Redaction Workflow
Tokenization and Analysis: The scanner tokenizes the text using the NLP engine and analyzes it against the configured recognizers.
PII Detection: Based on score thresholds, it determines whether PII is present and provides a risk score representing the likelihood of detected PII.
Redaction (optional): If sanitize is enabled, the scanner uses Presidio’s AnonymizerEngine to redact identified PII, replacing it with anonymized text.
Scoring and Responses
Risk Score: Represents the highest confidence score of detected PII within the text (1 for high likelihood, 0 for none).
Prediction and Sanitized Data:
If PII is detected, the scanner returns a "PII detected" message; otherwise, it returns "NO PII detected."
The result is provided with or without redaction, depending on the sanitize setting.

Continuing with the PiiDetector scanner, here are additional details on how it operates and handles various aspects of PII detection and redaction:

Error Handling and Logging
The PiiDetector uses the LogUtil utility for logging different levels of errors (e.g., missing entities, misconfigurations, or issues in the analysis process). By logging errors effectively:

It ensures that any issues with text analysis, entity recognition, or redaction are captured.
This provides valuable debugging information for cases where PII detection might fail or produce unexpected results.
predict() Method
The predict method is the core function that scans and, if enabled, redacts PII in the input text. Here’s a closer look at its operation:

Text Analysis:
It processes the input text to make it compatible with regex patterns by replacing certain special characters (like single quotes).
The AnalyzerEngine then runs the analysis based on the default entities and regex patterns. Each detected PII entity is assigned a score that reflects the confidence level of detection.
Score Thresholds:
The score_threshold attribute is used to determine whether detected entities meet the confidence criteria. Only entities with scores above this threshold are flagged as PII.
This configurable threshold provides flexibility in balancing sensitivity (catching more PII) with specificity (avoiding false positives).
PII Redaction:
If sanitize is enabled, the AnonymizerEngine replaces the detected PII entities with anonymized text (e.g., replacing a detected phone number with [PHONE]).
This ensures that sensitive information is completely removed from the processed text while maintaining the overall structure of the input data.
Response Structure:
predict() returns a tuple containing:
A message indicating whether PII was detected.
A risk_score indicating the level of confidence in the PII detection (higher scores indicate higher risk).
Optionally, the sanitized text if sanitize is enabled.
format_response() Method
This method structures the final response from the scanner, including:
Prediction: Adds the detection result under pii_detector in the response.
Score: Stores the risk score, which indicates the likelihood of PII being present in the input text.
Sanitized Data: If sanitize is active, the sanitized text replaces the original text in the response, ensuring that the returned data is devoid of sensitive information.
Use Cases
Compliance and Privacy:
PiiDetector is useful in environments where compliance with privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) is necessary. It helps in detecting and redacting PII from documents, customer feedback, emails, and other unstructured data.
Data Sanitization for Model Training:
When training machine learning models on customer data, sanitizing PII helps ensure privacy, enabling the use of data without risking exposure of sensitive information.
Internal Communication:
Organizations can use the PiiDetector to sanitize internal messages and documents to prevent accidental sharing of sensitive information.
Flexibility and Customization
The scanner’s configuration-driven approach makes it adaptable to different PII detection requirements.
Custom Entities and Patterns: By modifying pii_detector.yml, users can add entity types specific to their domain, making the scanner more versatile.
Dynamic Regex Patterns: Users can define complex patterns to capture organization-specific identifiers, allowing tailored PII detection beyond standard entities like names and emails.
Summary
The PiiDetector scanner provides a comprehensive solution for PII detection and redaction by leveraging the capabilities of Presidio and Spacy. With configurable entities and regex patterns, a choice of sanitization, and robust error handling, it is well-suited for a range of applications requiring data privacy and security.
