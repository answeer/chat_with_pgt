DeBERTa v3 introduces Replace-token Detection (RTD), inspired by the ELECTRA model. Unlike the traditional Masked Language Modeling (MLM) loss used in BERT, the RTD objective is more efficient. Here’s how it works:
	•	Objective: The model predicts whether a token has been replaced by another token during pre-training.
	•	Loss Function: Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) Loss.

Fine-tuning Loss Functions:

During fine-tuning, the loss function is determined by the specific downstream task. Common loss functions include:
	1.	Text Classification:
	•	Cross-Entropy Loss is typically used for tasks like sentiment analysis or topic classification.
	•	For multi-class classification:

\mathcal{L}{CE} = - \sum{i=1}^{C} y_i \cdot \log(p_i)

Where:
	•	 y_i  is the true label (one-hot encoded).
	•	 p_i  is the predicted probability for class  i .
	•	 C  is the number of classes.

Advantages of RTD over MLM in Pre-training:

	•	RTD avoids the inefficiencies of masking tokens, as MLM requires only masked tokens to contribute to the loss, whereas RTD allows all tokens to contribute.
	•	It results in faster convergence and more effective representation learning.
