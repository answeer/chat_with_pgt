This Secrets scanner is designed to detect and optionally sanitize sensitive information, like API keys or passwords, in text data. It leverages the detect-secrets library for detection and includes sanitization options that replace sensitive information with placeholders.

Key Components of Secrets

	1.	Use of detect-secrets Library:
	•	detect-secrets is a powerful tool for finding sensitive information by scanning for patterns commonly associated with secrets. The library’s SecretsCollection class is used here to collect any found secrets in the text.
	•	By scanning a temporary file containing the text, the scanner can use detect-secrets to identify potential secrets without needing a custom pattern.
	2.	Sanitization with TextReplaceBuilder:
	•	If sanitize is enabled, TextReplaceBuilder from Presidio Anonymizer is used to replace detected secrets with asterisks (or other placeholders).
	•	For each found secret, the TextReplaceBuilder calculates the position and length of the secret within the text and replaces it as specified.
	3.	Predict Method:
	•	Detection Process: The method creates a temporary file with the provided text, scans it using detect-secrets, and gathers any detected secrets.
	•	Replacement: If sanitize is enabled, each secret is located by position, and TextReplaceBuilder replaces it with asterisks.
	•	Logging: If any secrets are found, they are listed by type in the prediction message. Any errors during detection or replacement are logged.
	4.	Temporary File Management:
	•	A temporary file is used to scan the text, and it is safely removed after scanning to avoid leaving any sensitive information.

Example Usage Scenarios

The Secrets scanner can be used in various situations where sensitive data might accidentally be included in text, such as:

	•	Log Scrubbing: Removing credentials or tokens from logs.
	•	Data Pipeline Sanitization: Ensuring sensitive data doesn’t unintentionally propagate through different parts of a system.
	•	Document and Code Review: Detecting accidental inclusion of secrets in documents or code repositories.

Example Output

Here’s how the Secrets scanner might respond:

	•	If Secrets Are Detected:
	•	Prediction: "Detected secrets in text: <list of detected secret types>"
	•	Score: 1
	•	Sanitized Text: Returns the text with each detected secret replaced by asterisks or another placeholder.
	•	If No Secrets Are Found:
	•	Prediction: "No secrets detected in the text"
	•	Score: 0
	•	Sanitized Text: Returns the original text unaltered.

Code Enhancement Suggestions

To enhance usability, consider:

	1.	Allowing configuration of the placeholder (e.g., replacing with "[REDACTED]" instead of "******").
	2.	Including additional logging for each detected secret, potentially with location data for detailed tracking.
	3.	Allowing customization of the secret detection settings (e.g., specifying custom patterns or sensitivity levels).

This scanner provides a powerful tool for detecting and sanitizing secrets, ensuring sensitive data is safely managed and removed where necessary.
