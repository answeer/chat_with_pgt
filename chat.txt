File Data

	•	File Format Check
	•	Reason: Ensures that files are in a supported format, preventing errors during processing due to unsupported file types. This foundational check confirms that the file can be correctly parsed and utilized by the system.

Image Data

	•	Image Blurriness Check
	•	Reason: Identifies blurry images that lack clarity, which could impact tasks requiring clear visual data (e.g., computer vision tasks). Ensuring image sharpness improves the quality and reliability of analysis.
	•	Image Dimension Check
	•	Reason: Verifies that images meet minimum size requirements, avoiding issues with images that are too small to be useful for analysis or processing. This ensures the image provides adequate detail for its intended use.

Text Data

	•	Harmful String
	•	Reason: Detects potentially harmful or malicious content within text fields. Removing harmful strings helps maintain data integrity and safeguards against security risks.
	•	Profanity Check
	•	Reason: Filters out offensive or inappropriate language, especially useful for user-generated content to maintain compliance with content standards and ensure a positive user experience.
	•	PII Detector
	•	Reason: Flags personal identifiable information (PII) to help comply with privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR). Protecting PII prevents unintentional exposure of sensitive information.
	•	Remove Unicode
	•	Reason: Removes special Unicode characters, standardizing text data to reduce compatibility issues and ensure consistent processing.
	•	Secret Detector
	•	Reason: Detects sensitive information (e.g., passwords, API keys), preventing accidental leakage of confidential data, which is essential for data security.

Structured Data

	•	JSON Validator
	•	Reason: Ensures the integrity of JSON structures, confirming they are valid and well-formed. This is essential for systems that rely on structured data for accurate parsing and data handling.
