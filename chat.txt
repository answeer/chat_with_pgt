The BinTransform class provides a mechanism for categorizing values based on predefined ranges, allowing you to assign categories dynamically based on input data. This approach is useful in data analysis, classification tasks, or any scenario where you need to group numeric values into distinct categories.

Overview
Attributes:
default_category: The category that is returned if the input value does not fall within any defined range.
categories: A list of dictionaries, each specifying a category with its name and the range of values it covers.
Methods:
__init__:
Initializes the BinTransform instance with the default category and a list of categories. Each category is defined with its name and range.
predict:
Accepts a numeric value (int or float) and determines which category the value belongs to by checking it against the predefined ranges.
Returns: The name of the category if the value falls within a defined range; otherwise, it returns the default category.
Error Handling: Logs any exceptions that occur during the process.
format_response:
Formats the output by including the predicted category in the response dictionary. The score is set to None, as this implementation focuses on categorical classification rather than scoring.
Example Usage
Here’s a brief example of how to use the BinTransform class:

python
复制代码
# Initialize the BinTransform instance
bin_transformer = BinTransform(
    default="Uncategorized",
    categories=[
        {"name": "Low", "range": (0, 10)},
        {"name": "Medium", "range": (11, 20)},
        {"name": "High", "range": (21, 30)}
    ]
)

# Predict the category for a value
value = 15
category = bin_transformer.predict(value)
print(f"The category for the value {value} is '{category}'.")  # Output: Medium
Summary
The BinTransform class is a versatile tool for categorizing numeric data into defined groups based on specific criteria. Its design allows for easy customization of categories and ranges, making it suitable for various applications where classification of numerical values is required.
