The EncryptionDetector class is a valuable tool for identifying encrypted files across various formats. It is designed to detect and log encryption status, enabling systems to handle protected files with caution or prompt users for passwords. This helps maintain the security of applications that process files from potentially untrusted sources, such as in data ingestion pipelines, content management systems, or document review platforms.
