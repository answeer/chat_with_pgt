class ImageSizeCheck(Scanner):
    """
    A class to check the dimensions (height and width) of an image and validate them against specified thresholds.

    This class extends the `Scanner` base class and provides functionality to determine if an image file's dimensions
    meet the minimum required size.

    Attributes:
        img_size_thresh (tuple): A tuple containing the minimum required height and width for the image.

    Methods:
        predict(image_path):
            Checks the dimensions of the image and validates them against the specified thresholds.

        format_response():
            Formats the prediction response to include the result of the size check and the corresponding score.
