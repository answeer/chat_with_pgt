The TokenLimit scanner is designed to analyze and verify the number of tokens in a given text, ensuring it does not exceed a specified threshold. It provides a flexible approach by allowing multiple tokenization methods to accommodate different tokenization needs.

Key Features and Workflow:
Tokenization Methods:
The scanner supports several tokenization techniques:
Whitespace Tokenization: Splits text at each whitespace, providing a simple, space-based token count.
Word Punctuation Tokenization: Separates tokens based on words and punctuation, helpful for more granular token counts.
NLTK Word Tokenization: Uses NLTK’s tokenization approach, which is well-suited for natural language processing tasks.
SpaCy Tokenization: Leverages spaCy’s NLP pipeline, which provides contextually aware tokenization.
Token Count Check:
The TokenLimit scanner checks if the token count from the specified method falls within the acceptable limit (token_limit). If the token count is under the threshold, a score of 1 is assigned; otherwise, it assigns a score of 0. The scanner also provides a message detailing the token count for reference.
Error Handling:
If an unsupported tokenization method is chosen, the scanner provides an error message with a list of valid options.
In case of any processing errors, the scanner logs the error using LogUtil and returns an appropriate error message with a score of 0.
Usage Scenarios:
Text Limit Enforcements: Useful in applications where token limits are enforced, such as API calls, chatbots, or messaging platforms.
Analysis of Language Patterns: Allows flexibility in tokenization approaches, enabling various language processing tasks, including token-based NLP preprocessing.
