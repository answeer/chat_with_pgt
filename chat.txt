The ImageDimCheck class verifies whether the dimensions of an image (height and width) meet minimum threshold requirements. This is particularly useful in quality control workflows to ensure that images meet specific dimensional standards before further processing.

Overview
This class extends the Scanner base class and focuses on validating image dimensions against predefined minimum height and width values.

Core Components
Initialization (__init__ method):
Initializes the ImageDimCheck instance with:
img_dim_thresh: A tuple defining the minimum acceptable image dimensions (height, width).
Predict (predict method):
Checks if an image meets the required dimensions.
Steps:
Confirms the file extension is supported (e.g., TIFF, PNG, JPG).
Opens the image and retrieves its actual height and width.
Compares the image's dimensions to the specified thresholds.
Returns a message indicating whether the image dimensions are valid and assigns a score.
Args: Takes image_path (path to the image file).
Returns: A tuple with:
Prediction Message: Specifies whether the image size meets requirements.
Score: 1 if the image dimensions are valid, 0 if not.
Response Formatting (format_response method):
Updates the response dictionary with:
Prediction for Image Size: Message about the image's dimensional validity.
Score: Validity status (1 or 0).
Brief Introduction
The ImageDimCheck class verifies an image's dimensions, ensuring they meet minimum requirements. By validating image sizes before processing, it helps maintain quality standards in image-dependent workflows. This function is especially valuable for applications that require images to meet specific size standards before further processing or analysis.
