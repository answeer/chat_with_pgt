1. File Data

	•	Encryption Detector
	•	Purpose: Ensures that files are not encrypted, allowing access for processing.
	•	Reason: Encrypted files halt processing unless decrypted, leading to potential errors.
	•	File Format Check
	•	Purpose: Verifies files are in supported formats (e.g., PNG, JPEG, TXT).
	•	Reason: Unsupported formats can cause parsing errors or data loss, ensuring format compatibility avoids these issues.

2. Image Data

	•	Image Dimension Check
	•	Purpose: Confirms images meet minimum size requirements.
	•	Reason: Small images lack detail, impacting quality and usability in visual analysis.
	•	Image DPI Check
	•	Purpose: Checks DPI (dots per inch) for clarity and resolution.
	•	Reason: Low-DPI images may degrade processing accuracy, especially in high-quality applications.

3. Text Data

	•	Executable Scripts
	•	Purpose: Detects and removes embedded executable scripts (e.g., JavaScript).
	•	Reason: Prevents code injection attacks, ensuring system security.
	•	Profanity Check
	•	Purpose: Filters offensive or inappropriate language.
	•	Reason: Especially in user-generated content, this helps maintain content compliance.
	•	Token Limit
	•	Purpose: Limits text length.
	•	Reason: Manages processing resources by avoiding excessively long text inputs.
	•	PII Detector
	•	Purpose: Flags personal identifiable information (e.g., names, emails).
	•	Reason: Ensures privacy compliance (e.g., GDPR), protecting personal information.
	•	Secret Detector
	•	Purpose: Identifies sensitive information like passwords or API keys.
	•	Reason: Prevents accidental exposure or leakage of confidential information.

4. Structured Data Validation

	•	JSON Validation
	•	Purpose: Validates JSON structure.
	•	Reason: Ensures compatibility with systems that rely on structured data for parsing and processing.

Summary of Essential Default Scanners

	•	File Data: Encryption Detector, File Format Check
	•	Image Data: Image Dimension Check, Image DPI Check
	•	Text Data: Executable Scripts, Profanity Check, Token Limit, PII Detector, Secret Detector
	•	Structured Data Validation: JSON Validation

These scanners cover key security, format consistency, and compliance needs, ensuring that data can be processed safely and reliably across diverse formats.
