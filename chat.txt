The JsonValidator scanner is a validation tool designed to check if a JSON payload adheres to a specific structure and mandated key-value requirements, especially those requiring compliance with certain patterns. Here’s a detailed breakdown of how it operates:

Key Components of JsonValidator

	1.	Mandated Checks:
	•	During initialization, the JsonValidator accepts a dictionary called mandate_checks, where each key corresponds to a required field in the JSON and is mapped to a regular expression pattern that defines acceptable values for that key.
	•	This allows flexible validation of nested structures or complex patterns within the JSON payload.
	2.	Key Retrieval:
	•	The get_value method enables access to values within a nested JSON payload using dot notation, making it straightforward to validate deeply nested keys.
	3.	Validation of Mandated Keys:
	•	The check_mandate_keys method iterates through each key defined in mandate_checks.
	•	For each key:
	•	If the key is missing in the JSON, it adds an entry to predict and assigns a score of 0 for that key.
	•	If present, the method checks whether the value adheres to the specified regex pattern. If it does, a score of 1 is assigned; if it doesn’t, the key’s value is noted as invalid in predict.
	4.	JSON Format Check:
	•	The check_json_format method ensures the input is a valid JSON by attempting to parse it. Any errors in this parsing process are captured and reported, which is useful for handling improperly formatted JSON data.
	5.	Predict Method:
	•	The main method, predict, first verifies the format of the input payload. If it isn’t valid JSON, an error is returned.
	•	If valid, it proceeds with the mandate key checks, accumulating both the prediction results and average score for the validation outcome.
	6.	Formatting the Response:
	•	format_response integrates the predictions and score into the response dictionary, making it compatible with other scanners.

Example Scenarios for JsonValidator

The JsonValidator can be highly useful in the following cases:

	•	API Input Validation: Ensuring the structure and values of JSON payloads submitted via APIs match the expected format before processing.
	•	Data Integrity Checks: Validating that JSON configurations or settings files contain mandatory fields with acceptable values.
	•	Compliance Verification: Enforcing that required fields in data submissions follow specific patterns, such as email formats, date structures, or numeric ranges.

Example Outputs

	•	Valid JSON, All Checks Passed:
	•	Prediction: ["Valid JSON payload."]
	•	Score: 1
	•	Indicates the JSON matches the mandated structure and all patterns.
	•	Missing or Invalid Keys:
	•	Prediction: ["Key emailnot found", "For Keydate value '13-25-2023' is not in the correct pattern."]
	•	Score: Calculated as the mean score, reflecting the proportion of fields that passed validation.
	•	Invalid JSON Format:
	•	Prediction: Returns the parsing error, like "Expecting ',' delimiter: line 1 column 42 (char 41)"
	•	Score: 0

Code Enhancement Suggestions

	1.	Dynamic Error Messages: Adding more specific error messages could help users quickly understand why a particular value is invalid.
	2.	Enhanced Pattern Matching: Allow specifying multiple acceptable patterns per key to handle cases where different formats may be acceptable.
	3.	Additional Key Type Checks: Implement type checking to ensure values match expected data types (e.g., string, integer), in addition to pattern matching.

With its flexible validation rules and handling of nested JSON, JsonValidator is a comprehensive scanner for JSON structure and value validation.
