class BlankPageCheck(Scanner):
    """
    A class to detect blank pages in a document using brightness and contour analysis.

    This class extends the `Scanner` base class to analyze images of document pages and identify 
    blank pages based on specified brightness and contour thresholds.

    Attributes:
        brightness_thresh (float): The threshold for determining if a page is blank based on brightness.
        countour_thresh (int): The threshold for determining if a page is blank based on the number of contours.
        save_folder (str): The directory to save images extracted from the document.

    Methods:
        suaitability_placeholder(image_path):
            Placeholder method for evaluating an image's suitability based on brightness and contour estimates.
        
        predict(image_path):
            Analyzes the document pages to identify blank pages based on brightness and contour thresholds.
        
        format_response():
            Formats the prediction response to include the indices of blank pages and the overall score.
