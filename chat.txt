he ImageMemoryCheck class is designed to validate the memory size of image files against specified thresholds, ensuring they meet certain criteria in terms of file size. This can be particularly useful in applications where image size is critical for performance, storage, or compliance reasons.

Overview
Attributes:
max_size: The maximum allowable size for the image in kilobytes (KB).
min_size: The minimum allowable size for the image in kilobytes (KB).
Methods:
__init__:
Initializes the class by setting up the size thresholds for image memory.
predict:
Checks the memory size of the specified image file.
Validates whether the size falls within the defined minimum and maximum thresholds.
Returns: A tuple containing:
A prediction message indicating if the image size is valid.
A score (1 if valid, 0 if not).
format_response:
Formats the prediction results and updates the response dictionary with the memory check results and the score.
Summary
The ImageMemoryCheck class is a useful utility in any image processing workflow, ensuring that images meet specified memory size requirements. This validation helps maintain performance standards and can prevent issues related to handling excessively large or small images in various applications.
