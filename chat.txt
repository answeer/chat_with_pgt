ProtectAI

Advantages:

	1.	Perfect Precision for Positive Class:
	•	No false positives in predicting the Positive class.
	2.	Flawless Recall for Negative Class:
	•	Captures all true negatives with 100% recall.
	3.	High F1-Score:
	•	Consistently performs well across both classes, particularly the Negative class (F1-score: 0.96).

Disadvantages:

	1.	Lower Recall for Positive Class:
	•	A recall of 0.84 for the Positive class indicates that some true positives are misclassified as negatives.
	2.	Imbalanced Performance:
	•	There’s a notable disparity between the recall of the Negative class (1.00) and the Positive class (0.84), which may lead to skewed results in datasets with imbalanced class distributions.

SavantAI

Advantages:

	1.	Balanced Performance:
	•	Both classes have nearly identical precision, recall, and F1-scores, making it suitable for applications requiring consistency across all classes.
	2.	High F1-Score for Positive Class:
	•	With an F1-score of 0.91, it performs well in identifying the Positive class, striking a balance between precision and recall.

Disadvantages:

	1.	Lower Precision Compared to ProtectAI for Positive Class:
	•	Precision for the Positive class is 0.91, slightly lower than ProtectAI’s perfect 1.00.
	2.	Potential Overfitting to Balance:
	•	Its uniform performance could suggest it’s optimized for balanced datasets, possibly limiting its adaptability to imbalanced scenarios.

Setfit

Advantages:

	1.	Moderate Recall for Negative Class:
	•	With a recall of 0.76, it detects most negative samples reasonably well, although it’s far from the performance of the other two models.

Disadvantages:

	1.	Poor Positive Class Performance:
	•	Precision and recall for the Positive class are 0.34 and 0.26, respectively, leading to a low F1-score (0.29). This indicates significant misclassification of positive samples.
	2.	Inconsistent Across Classes:
	•	Disparity in performance between the Negative and Positive classes suggests a lack of robustness.
	3.	Overall Weak Metrics:
	•	With the lowest scores across all metrics, it’s unsuitable for applications requiring high accuracy or balanced predictions.
