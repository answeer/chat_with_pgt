The ImageDPICheck class verifies that images extracted from documents meet specified DPI (dots per inch) requirements in both the X and Y dimensions, ensuring they are suitable for applications that depend on high-resolution images. This class is an extension of the Scanner base class and is helpful in workflows where image clarity and detail are critical.

Overview
Attributes:
x_dpi_thresh: The minimum acceptable DPI in the X dimension.
y_dpi_thresh: The minimum acceptable DPI in the Y dimension.
save_folder: Directory where the converted images will be saved.
Methods:
__init__:
Sets up DPI thresholds and the save folder for images.
suitability_placeholder:
Acts as a placeholder method for DPI calculation using image_xy_dpi.
predict:
Converts the document to images.
Checks each image's DPI values and identifies images below threshold requirements.
Returns: A list of indices of pages with low DPI and a score (1 if all images meet thresholds, 0 if any do not).
format_response:
Formats and updates the prediction results and score in the response dictionary.
Summary
The ImageDPICheck class assists in ensuring that document images maintain adequate resolution by comparing DPI values against set thresholds. This validation helps uphold quality standards, especially in document processing pipelines that rely on image detail for analysis or reproduction.
