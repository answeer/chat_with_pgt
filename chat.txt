Dear [Cost Center Owner's Name],

I hope this email finds you well.

I am writing to formally request your approval for the transfer of a monitor currently used by my colleague, [Colleague’s Name], to be reassigned to me. This monitor (Asset ID: [若有资产编号，请填写，如: ABC-123] / Brand & Model: [若未知则省略]) is no longer needed by [Colleague’s Name] and is in full working condition.

As this is an internal transfer within the team, ​there will be no additional cost​ to the cost center. This reassignment will allow me to efficiently support my daily tasks without requiring new equipment.

Kindly approve this request at your earliest convenience. Once approved, I will coordinate with [Colleague’s Name] and the IT/Asset Management team to complete the transfer process.

Thank you for your support. Please let me know if you require further details.
