File-Type Specific Methods: Each method uses file-specific libraries to check for encryption:
is_pwd_pdf: Uses fitz to detect if a PDF requires a password (needs_pass attribute).
is_pwd_msdoc: Uses msoffcrypto to check encryption in Microsoft Office documents (e.g., .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx).
is_pwd_7z: Uses py7zr for 7z archives. It attempts to extract the archive and returns True if a password is required.
is_pwd_zip: Uses zipfile to test if a ZIP archive is encrypted by attempting to read its content.
