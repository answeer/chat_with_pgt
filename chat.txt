The ExecutableScript class provides a robust tool for sanitizing HTML by detecting and identifying tags and attributes that may contain harmful scripts. This is particularly useful for applications where HTML content from unknown or untrusted sources needs to be processed safely, such as in user-generated content platforms, web scrapers, or any system handling dynamic HTML input. By identifying and flagging risky elements, it helps maintain the security of the application and prevents script-based attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS).
